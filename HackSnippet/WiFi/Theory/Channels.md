In the case of 802.11 protocol that use 2.4 GHz spectrum ```each channel width is 22 MHz wide```

Channel bands are separeted by 5 MHz of unuse spectrum (white space)

| Channel | Start spectrum | End spectrum | Center at |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 2.400 | 2.422 | 2.412 |
| 2 | 2.405 | 2.427 | 2.417 |
| 3 | 2.410 | 2.432 | 2.422 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 13 | 2.460 | 2.482 | 2.472 |
| 14 | ... | ... | 2.484 |

Channel 14 has 12 MHz of unused spectrum... The special boy...

```Use channel 1, 6, 11, 14 to avoid overlap```
