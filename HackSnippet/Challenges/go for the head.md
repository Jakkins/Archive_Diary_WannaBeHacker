## Stepping Stones

- install Kali, or ArchLinux
- prepare your mind to learn to use Python, assembly and C
- deauth your Smartphone from your WiFi
  - set up an "evil twin" access point and de-authentication the target
  - there are other methods for disconnecting users from wireless networks, such as ARP spoofing, with these attacks designed with the same purpose in mind
- capture handshake
- look at the open port of your router
- crack a password using dictionaries
  - passive search for new dictionaries


##

For example, an attacker could disconnect all users from a nearby network and prevent any new users from connecting

## Collateral Objectives (don't mind at these, these are collateral, have fun!)

- learn to use Linux Bash and terminals emulator
  - ```a shell that use bash to communicate with Linux kernel```

- learn to use programs like
  - aircrack-ng
  - mdk3
  - nmap
